# Suicide Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithm of Naive Bayes, Linear SVC and BERT with Features of Sentiment Polarity and Emotion

- Built a suicide prediction model using machine learning with additional feature of sentiment polarity and emotion
- Project involve of sentiment polarity analysis
- Project involve of emotion analysis
- Project involve of text feature engineering (BoWs, TFIDF)
- Machine Learning Algorithms used involved Naive Bayes, Linear SVC and BERT
- Project involve of text data preprocessing (deal with missing data, unwanted class, contraction expansion, punctuation, stop word, lower casing, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, digit, duplicate text data and unnecessary pattern of text)
- Project involve of scrapping Twitter text data for model testing
- Built a simple web application using Library Streamlit (user able to upload file or input text for suicide prediction, result will be printed out and available for downloading)
- Coding language used is python
